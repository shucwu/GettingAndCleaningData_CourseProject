# CodeBook.md

This is the CodeBook for the Course Project of Getting and Cleaning Data. It describes the source data, the varaibles in the output tidy dataset (tidydataset.txt in repo), and  transformations performed to the source data in order to produce the tidy dataset (run_analysis.R in repo). 

## Purpose of Project

The purpose of the project is to create a tidy data set based on the data collected from the accelerometers from the Samsung Galaxy S smartphone.

## Required Resources 

* Unzipped data folder "UCI HAR Dataset" present in the working directory of RStudio
* R package libraries: dplyr, plyr, reshape2



## Transformation Performed

 Don't just make a tidy data set, make it clear to people reviewing it why it is tidy. When you given the variables descriptive names, explain why the names are descriptive. Don't give your reviewers the opportunity to be confused about your work, spell it out to them.
